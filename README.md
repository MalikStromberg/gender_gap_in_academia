# Project
This project is a core part of the M.Sc. Data Science in Business & Economics program at the University of Tuebingen. Together with my colleague Franziska Mueller I provide a tool that enables the user to visualise and analyse certain aspects of gender differences in publishing in the field of Business and Economics, e.g. considering different subfields, development over time, or with respect to academic impact. The paper below serves as a use case example.
